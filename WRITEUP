Reading Input File (O(n)):
We iterate over each line of the input file, where n is the number of words in the input file. This operation takes O(n) time.

Reading CSV File (O(m)):
We iterate over each line of the CSV file, where m is the number of lines in the CSV file. This operation takes O(m) time.

Passing and Processing CSV Data (O(m * k * log(k))):
For each line in the CSV file, we parse the data and process it.
Passing each line involves splitting the line based on commas and semicolons, which takes O(k) time for each word, where k is the maximum length of a word.
After passing, we sort the characters of each word alphabetically. Sorting k characters takes O(k * log(k)) time.
Since we perform these operations for each word in each line of the CSV file, the total time complexity for passing and processing the CSV data is O(m * k * log(k)).

Writing Output (O(n)):
For each word in the input file, we write the results to the output file. This operation takes O(n) time.

Generalized Time Complexity:
O(n * (k * log(k) + m))

n: Number of words in the input file.
m: Number of lines in the CSV file.
k: Maximum length of a word.
